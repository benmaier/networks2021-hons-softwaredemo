# Software demo "HONS" at Networks 2021

This is code I prepared and recreated live during a
presentation session at "Networks 2021" (in the HON satellite).

## Resources

* work with temporal networks: [tacoma](github.com/benmaier/tacoma)
* visualize static networks: [netwulf](github.com/benmaier/netwulf)
* construct and analyze infectious disease models: [epipack](github.com/benmaier/epipack)

These packages should be installed, otherwise the code won't run.

Versions:
```python
In [4]: tacoma.__version__
Out[4]: '0.1.19'

In [7]: epipack.metadata.__version__
Out[7]: '0.1.5'

In [9]: nw.__version__
Out[9]: '0.1.5
```
